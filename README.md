# Alfred Emoji Pack Update

This is an updated version of the original alfred emoji pack to include new emojis in unicode 12.
Even if the script was written quickly, it is now more useable, and supports I18N.

    2. Set your prefix and suffix ![prefixsuffix.png](manual/prefixsuffix.png)
    3. If you don't plan to use a suffix, then download and install the [alternative snippets file](https://github.com/paris-ci/Alfred-Emoji-Pack-Update/raw/master/snippets/Emoji%20Pack%20Update%20Deduped.alfredsnippets) to avoid shorter keywords overriding the longer compound ones (`+1` becomes `+1‚ê£` to allow entering `1_tone1`)
4. Enjoy !
